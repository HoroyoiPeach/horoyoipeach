### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Choe Jiwon.

I am student attending [SeoulTech](https://en.seoultech.ac.kr/). My major is Computer Science & Engineering.

My student number is **22101216**.

I was drinking :beer: when I signed up for Github. So my name became [Horoyoi](https://www.suntory.com/brands/horoyoi/).
